Latency Tester
==============

Firmware, Schematics, and Mechanicals for the Oculus Latency Tester

Firmware
--------

The Latency Tester firmware uses the CooCox CoIDE for development along with 
the gcc-arm-embedded toolchain.

The ST-Link/V2 is the cheapest way to load firmware onto a Latency Tester
board, though any SWD compatible programmer should work.
