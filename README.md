Firmware
--------

The Latency Tester firmware uses the CooCox CoIDE for development along with 
the gcc-arm-embedded toolchain.

The ST-Link/V2 is the cheapest way to load firmware onto a Latency Tester
board, though any SWD compatible programmer should work.

Mechanical
----------

The Mechanical folder contains STLs of a version of the Latency Tester housing
that is printable on low cost 3D printers.

Schematics
----------

The Schematics folder contains an image of the schematic currently, but will
be updated with a BOM and EAGLE Cad source for the PCB.
